		<p>This is a free-to-use extension that I wrote as a hobby. It requires less than 1MB of storage and allows you
			to draw lines on your current web page.
		</p>

		<p>I am a Computer Science student at City College, International Faculty of the University of Sheffield.
			I enjoy developing websites and plugins in my free time. If you have found any problems or have any ideas about
			the extension you can email me at <a href="mailto:damgiankakis@gmail.com">damgiankakis@gmail.com</a>.
		</p>

		<p>The extension does not work on images, pdf files and on chrome's default pages.</p>
